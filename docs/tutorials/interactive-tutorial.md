## 🚀 Tutorial 2: SPARC Methodology Mastery (Intermediate)

### Objective
Master the SPARC development methodology for systematic AI-assisted development.

### Step 1: Understanding SPARC

SPARC stands for:
- **S**pecification: Define requirements clearly
- **P**seudocode: Create algorithmic structure  
- **A**rchitecture: Design system components
- **R**efinement: Implement with AI assistance
- **C**ompletion: Test and validate results

### Step 2: Start a SPARC Workflow

1. Open a new project: `weather-dashboard`
2. Press `Ctrl+W` to open SPARC workflow
3. Select "Create New SPARC Workflow"

### Step 3: Specification Phase

The AI will guide you through defining requirements:

```
🤖 AI: Let's define the weather dashboard requirements.

What features should it include?
> Enter: "Real-time weather data, 5-day forecast, location search, favorites"

What technologies do you prefer?
> Enter: "React, TypeScript, Weather API, Tailwind CSS"

What's the target audience?
> Enter: "General users who want quick weather information"
```

**Expected Result**: A comprehensive specification document is generated.

### Step 4: Pseudocode Phase

Watch as the AI creates algorithmic structure:

```javascript
// Generated pseudocode
function WeatherDashboard() {
  // 1. Initialize state for weather data
  // 2. Set up location detection
  // 3. Fetch weather data from API
  // 4. Render current conditions
  // 5. Display forecast
  // 6. Handle location search
  // 7. Manage favorites
}
```

**Interactive Exercise**: Review the pseudocode and suggest modifications:
```bash
> "Add error handling for API failures"
> "Include weather alerts and warnings"
```

### Step 5: Architecture Phase

The AI designs the system architecture:

```
Components:
├── WeatherDashboard (Main)
├── CurrentWeather (Current conditions)
├── Forecast (5-day forecast)
├── LocationSearch (Search functionality)
├── Favorites (Saved locations)
└── ErrorBoundary (Error handling)

Services:
├── WeatherAPI (External API integration)
├── LocationService (Geolocation)
└── StorageService (Local storage)

State Management:
└── WeatherStore (Zustand/Redux)
```

### Step 6: Refinement Phase (TDD Implementation)

Watch the AI implement using Test-Driven Development:

1. **Tests First**: AI writes tests for each component
2. **Implementation**: AI writes code to pass tests  
3. **Refactor**: AI optimizes and cleans up code
4. **Validate**: Anti-Hallucination Engine checks quality

**Interactive Exercise**: Guide the AI's implementation:
```bash
> "Use TypeScript interfaces for weather data"
> "Implement loading states for better UX"
> "Add responsive design breakpoints"
```

### Step 7: Completion Phase

Final integration and validation:

1. **Integration Testing**: All components work together
2. **Performance Testing**: Load times and responsiveness
3. **Quality Validation**: 95.8% precision check
4. **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs

### 🎉 Checkpoint 2 Complete!

You've mastered:
- SPARC methodology workflow
- AI-guided requirement specification
- Test-driven development with AI
- System architecture design

## ⚡ Tutorial 3: Advanced Agent Swarm Orchestration (Advanced)

### Objective
Learn to orchestrate multiple AI agent swarms for complex, concurrent development tasks.

### Step 1: Initialize Agent Swarm

```bash
# In TUI command palette (Tab)
> "Initialize agent swarm for e-commerce platform"
```

This will spawn specialized agent teams:

**Backend Team**:

### Step 2: Coordinate Parallel Development

Watch as teams work in parallel:

```bash
# Teams coordinate through shared memory
Backend Team: Creating user authentication API
Frontend Team: Building login component
DevOps Team: Setting up staging environment

# Cross-team coordination
Frontend requests API specification from Backend
Backend provides OpenAPI schema
DevOps sets up database for Backend team
```

**Interactive Exercise**: Direct team coordination:
```bash
> "Backend team: Add payment processing API"
> "Frontend team: Create checkout flow UI"  
> "DevOps team: Set up payment gateway integration"
```

### Step 3: Monitor Agent Performance

Use the performance dashboard to monitor:

- **Task Completion Rate**: 89% (23/26 tasks)
- **Code Quality Score**: 96.2% (Anti-Hallucination)
- **Team Coordination**: Excellent (0 conflicts)
- **Resource Usage**: 2.1GB memory, 45% CPU

### Step 4: Handle Complex Integrations

When teams need to integrate, watch the AI orchestrate:

```bash
# Integration challenge detected
🤖 System: Frontend team needs API authentication tokens
         Backend team has JWT implementation ready
         Coordinating integration...

# Automatic coordination
1. Backend exposes authentication endpoints
2. Frontend implements token storage
3. DevOps configures secure token refresh
4. Testing team validates end-to-end flow
```

### Step 5: Performance Optimization

Learn advanced performance tuning:

```bash
> "Optimize agent memory usage"
# AI redistributes memory allocation
