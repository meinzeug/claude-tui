## ⚠️ Critical Architecture Issues

### 1. **Missing Core Implementations**
**Severity: CRITICAL**

Found extensive fallback implementations in `main_app.py`:
```python
# Fallback imports for development
class ProjectManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_project = None  # Mock implementation
```

**Issues Identified:**
- Core `ProjectManager` not properly implemented
- `AIInterface` and `ValidationEngine` have stub implementations
- Critical business logic missing or mocked

**Recommendation:** Immediate implementation of core business logic required.

### 2. **High Complexity and Coupling**
**Severity: HIGH**

**Complex Components:**
- `AntiHallucinationEngine`: 1,239 lines, high cyclomatic complexity
- `TaskEngine`: 686 lines with resource management complexity
- `SecurityInputValidator`: 933 lines with multiple pattern systems

**Coupling Issues:**
- Tight integration between validation components
- Circular import potential in core modules
- Hard-coded dependencies throughout system

### 3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
**Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Identified Issues:**
- ML model loading synchronously blocks initialization
- Large feature extraction operations in main thread
- Memory-intensive validation caches without bounds
- No connection pooling for external services

### 4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Mixed exception handling strategies
- Inconsistent error response formats
- Missing error recovery mechanisms
- Some components lack proper cleanup
