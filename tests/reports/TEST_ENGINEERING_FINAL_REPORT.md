## 🚨 Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Expand Unit Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for all core modules in `src/claude_tui/core/`
   - Target 90%+ coverage for critical components
   - Implement property-based testing for edge cases

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add try-catch blocks to critical functions
   - Implement comprehensive logging system
   - Create error recovery mechanisms
   - Add circuit breaker patterns for external APIs

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Deploy continuous performance monitoring
   - Set up alerting for performance regressions
   - Implement automated performance testing in CI/CD

### Production Deployment Path
1. **Phase 1**: Address blocking issues (test coverage, error handling)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting  
3. **Phase 3**: Staged production rollout with performance validation
4. **Phase 4**: Full production deployment with continuous monitoring
