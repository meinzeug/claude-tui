"""
claude-tui test suite.

This package contains all tests for the claude-tui project:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system interactions  
- UI tests for terminal interface components
- Validation tests for anti-hallucination features
- Performance and load tests
- Security and input validation tests

Test organization:
- tests/unit/ - Unit tests for core modules
- tests/integration/ - Integration tests for CLI and external services
- tests/ui/ - TUI component and screen tests
- tests/validation/ - Anti-hallucination and placeholder detection tests
- tests/performance/ - Performance, load, and scalability tests
- tests/security/ - Security, validation, and sandbox tests
- tests/fixtures/ - Shared test data and mock factories

Run all tests:
    pytest

Run with coverage:
    pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

Run specific test categories:
    pytest tests/unit/                    # Unit tests only
    pytest tests/integration/             # Integration tests only
    pytest -m "not performance"          # Skip performance tests
    pytest -m "security"                 # Security tests only
    pytest --slow                        # Include slow tests

Test markers:
- unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- integration: Integration tests (slower, external dependencies)
- ui: TUI component tests
- performance: Performance and benchmarking tests
- security: Security validation tests
- slow: Tests that take longer to run
- benchmark: Benchmark tests using pytest-benchmark
